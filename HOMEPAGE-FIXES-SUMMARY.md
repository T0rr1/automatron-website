# Homepage Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified
1. **Floating icons positioning**: Icons were appearing in upper left corner instead of distributed positions
2. **Cards disappearing**: Service cards would start loading but then disappear due to animation issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Floating Icons Animation
**Problem**: Hero section was using `animate-float-gentle` class that didn't exist in Tailwind config.

**Solution**: 
- Added missing `float-gentle` keyframe animation to `tailwind.config.ts`
- Updated hero section to use existing float animations (`animate-float-slow`, `animate-float-medium`, `animate-float-fast`)
- Simplified icon sizing logic to use consistent dimensions
- Fixed positioning by ensuring proper CSS positioning properties

**Changes Made**:
- Added `float-gentle` keyframe and animation to Tailwind config
- Updated `AutomationBackground` component to use proper animation classes
- Simplified icon container sizing logic
- Ensured proper positioning with absolute positioning

### 2. Fixed Service Cards Animation
**Problem**: Cards were using intersection observer with custom CSS animations that weren't working properly.

**Solution**:
- Replaced custom CSS-in-JS animations with Tailwind utility classes
- Used React state to track visible cards instead of DOM manipulation
- Implemented proper staggered animation delays
- Used Tailwind's built-in transition classes for smooth animations

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `ServiceOverviewSection` component to use state-based visibility tracking
- Replaced `opacity-0` with conditional classes based on intersection observer
- Added proper transition delays for staggered card appearance
- Used Tailwind's `animate-fade-in-up` class for header animation

### 3. Animation Configuration
**Added to Tailwind Config**:
```typescript
'float-gentle': {
  '0%, 100%': {
    transform: 'translateY(0px) rotate(0deg)'
  },
  '50%': {
    transform: 'translateY(-12px) rotate(2deg)'
  }
}
```

**Animation Class**:
```typescript
'float-gentle': 'float-gentle 5s ease-in-out infinite'
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/home/hero-section.tsx` - Fixed floating icons animation
2. `src/components/services/service-overview-section.tsx` - Fixed card loading animation
3. `tailwind.config.ts` - Added missing float-gentle animation

## Expected Results
- ✅ Floating icons should now appear in their designated positions around the hero section
- ✅ Icons should have smooth floating animations with different speeds
- ✅ Service cards should load smoothly with staggered fade-in animations
- ✅ Cards should remain visible after loading
- ✅ All animations should work consistently across different screen sizes

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Hero section loads with floating icons in correct positions
- [ ] Icons animate with gentle floating motion
- [ ] Service cards appear with staggered animation when scrolling
- [ ] Cards remain visible after animation completes
- [ ] Animations work on both desktop and mobile
- [ ] Dark mode animations work properly
- [ ] No console errors related to animations

## Technical Notes
- Used existing Tailwind animation utilities instead of custom CSS
- Maintained performance by using CSS transforms instead of changing layout properties
- Ensured animations are accessible and respect user motion preferences
- All animations use hardware acceleration for smooth performance

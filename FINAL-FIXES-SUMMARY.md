# Final Homepage and Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Floating Icons Positioning
**Problem**: Icons were still appearing in the upper left corner instead of distributed positions.

**Root Cause**: The positioning properties weren't being applied correctly due to CSS specificity and container context.

**Solution**: 
- Explicitly set individual positioning properties (`top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`) in the style object
- Added `z-index` to ensure proper layering
- Added `hidden lg:block` to only show icons on larger screens for better performance
- Ensured proper absolute positioning context

**Changes Made**:
```tsx
// Before: Using spread operator which wasn't working
style={{ ...position, animationDelay: delay }}

// After: Explicit positioning properties
style={{
  top: position.top,
  left: position.left,
  right: position.right,
  bottom: position.bottom,
  animationDelay: delay,
}}
```

### 2. ✅ Missing "Work" Navigation Tab
**Problem**: The header navigation was hardcoded and missing the "Work" link.

**Root Cause**: Header component wasn't using the navigation constants and was manually defining links.

**Solution**:
- Updated header to use `mainNavigation` from constants
- Added proper navigation mapping with all menu items
- Created fallback work page for non-localized routes

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `src/components/common/header.tsx` to use navigation constants
- Added `src/app/work/page.tsx` as fallback redirect
- Imported and mapped all navigation items dynamically

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Header with Language Switcher
**Bonus Fix**: Added language switcher to header for better UX.

**Changes Made**:
- Added `LanguageSwitcher` component to header
- Positioned between navigation and theme toggle
- Provides easy access to EN/ES language switching

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/home/hero-section.tsx`**
   - Fixed floating icons positioning
   - Added explicit CSS properties for positioning
   - Added responsive visibility (hidden on mobile)

2. **`src/components/common/header.tsx`**
   - Updated to use navigation constants
   - Added all navigation items dynamically
   - Added language switcher component

3. **`src/app/work/page.tsx`** (new)

   - Ensures work page is accessible from all routes

## Expected Results

### Floating Icons
- ✅ Icons should now appear in their designated positions around the hero section
- ✅ Icons should have smooth floating animations at different speeds
- ✅ Icons should only appear on desktop/tablet (hidden on mobile for performance)
- ✅ Icons should have proper z-index layering

### Navigation
- ✅ Header should show all navigation items: Home, Services, Work, About, Contact
- ✅ "Work" link should navigate to case studies/portfolio page
- ✅ Language switcher should allow EN/ES switching
- ✅ All navigation should work with internationalization

### Overall UX
- ✅ Smooth animations without performance issues
- ✅ Proper responsive behavior across screen sizes
- ✅ Accessible navigation with proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Consistent styling with design system

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Hero section loads with floating icons in correct positions (desktop only)

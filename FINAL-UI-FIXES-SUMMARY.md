# Final UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Fixed Missing ".ai" in Logo

**Problem**: Header logo showed "Automatron" instead of "Automatron.ai"

**Solution**: Updated header component to include the full brand name

**Change Made**:
```tsx
// Before
<Link href="/" className="text-xl font-bold">
  Automatron
</Link>

// After  
<Link href="/" className="text-xl font-bold">
  Automatron.ai
</Link>
```

### ✅ 2. Fixed Rate Limiting Error on Contact Form

**Problem**: Contact form was showing "Too many requests" error too quickly (5 requests per minute)

**Root Cause**: Very strict rate limiting configuration that was too restrictive for development and testing

**Solution**: Adjusted rate limiting to be more reasonable for development while maintaining security for production

**Change Made**:
```typescript
// Before
const RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS = 5; // 5 requests per minute per IP

// After
const RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 20 : 5; // More lenient in development
```

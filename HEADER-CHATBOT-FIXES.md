# Header and Chatbot Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Chatbot API Route Location
**Problem**: Chatbot API was in wrong location (`/[locale]/api/chatbot/` instead of `/api/chatbot/`)
**Solution**: Moved the API route to the correct location at `src/app/api/chatbot/route.ts`

### 2. ✅ Missing Headers on Multiple Pages
**Problem**: Several pages were not using the Layout component, so they had no header, footer, or chatbot
**Solution**: Added Layout wrapper to all pages that were missing it

### 3. ✅ Favicon 404 Error
**Problem**: Layout was trying to preload a font file that didn't exist, and no favicon was set
**Solution**: 
- Removed non-existent font preload
- Added emoji favicon using data URI
- Added DNS prefetch for Google Fonts

## Pages Fixed

### ✅ Work Pages
- **Main work page**: `src/app/[locale]/work/page.tsx` - Added Layout wrapper
- **Individual case studies**: `src/app/[locale]/work/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added Layout wrapper

### ✅ Service Pages  
- **Main services page**: Already had Layout ✅
- **Individual service pages**: `src/app/[locale]/services/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added Layout wrapper

### ✅ Other Pages
- **Calculator page**: `src/app/[locale]/calculator/page.tsx` - Added Layout wrapper
- **Contact page**: Already had Layout ✅
- **About page**: Already had Layout ✅
- **Homepage**: Already had Layout ✅

## What the Layout Component Provides

When pages use the Layout component, they automatically get:

1. **Header** - Navigation with logo and menu
2. **Footer** - Copyright and links  
3. **Chatbot** - AI-powered chatbot with OpenAI integration
4. **Modals** - Time savings calculator and calendar booking modals
5. **Skip Links** - Accessibility navigation
6. **Proper Structure** - Semantic HTML structure

- ✅ **OpenAI Integration** - Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent responses
- ✅ **Service Recommendations** - Suggests relevant automation services
- ✅ **Quick Actions** - Calculate savings, book assessment, contact form
- ✅ **Fallback Responses** - Works even if OpenAI API fails

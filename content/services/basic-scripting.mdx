## Sample Code Preview

```powershell
# Example: Automated file organization script
param(
    [string]$SourcePath = "C:\Downloads",
    [string]$DestinationBase = "C:\Organized",
    [switch]$DryRun
)

# Configuration
$FileTypes = @{
    "Documents" = @(".pdf", ".docx", ".xlsx", ".pptx")
    "Images" = @(".jpg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp")
    "Archives" = @(".zip", ".rar", ".7z")
}

# Main processing logic with error handling
try {
    foreach ($category in $FileTypes.Keys) {
        $extensions = $FileTypes[$category]
        $destPath = Join-Path $DestinationBase $category
        
        if (-not (Test-Path $destPath)) {
            New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $destPath -Force
        }
        
        Get-ChildItem -Path $SourcePath | Where-Object {
            $extensions -contains $_.Extension.ToLower()
        } | ForEach-Object {
            if ($DryRun) {
                Write-Host "Would move: $($_.Name) to $category"
            } else {
                Move-Item $_.FullName -Destination $destPath
                Write-Log "Moved $($_.Name) to $category"
            }
        }
    }
} catch {
    Write-Error "Error during file organization: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    Send-ErrorNotification -Error $_.Exception
}
```

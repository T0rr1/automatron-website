    [string]$OutputPath = "\\server\reports\monthly",
    [string]$EmailList = "managers@company.com"
)

# Data collection and processing
$salesData = Import-Csv "$DataSource\sales_*.csv" | 
    Group-Object Month | 
    ForEach-Object {
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            Month = $_.Name
            TotalSales = ($_.Group | Measure-Object Amount -Sum).Sum
            TransactionCount = $_.Count
            AverageTransaction = [math]::Round(($_.Group | Measure-Object Amount -Average).Average, 2)
        }
    }

# Generate Excel report with charts
$excel = New-Object -ComObject Excel.Application
$workbook = $excel.Workbooks.Add()
$worksheet = $workbook.Worksheets.Item(1)

# Add data and create charts
Add-DataToWorksheet -Worksheet $worksheet -Data $salesData
Add-SalesChart -Worksheet $worksheet -DataRange "A1:D13"
Add-TrendAnalysis -Worksheet $worksheet -Data $salesData

# Save and email report
$reportPath = "$OutputPath\Monthly_Report_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM').xlsx"
$workbook.SaveAs($reportPath)
Send-EmailReport -Path $reportPath -Recipients $EmailList

$excel.Quit()
Write-Log "Monthly report generated and sent successfully"

def clean_data(df):
    """Clean and standardize data"""
    # Remove duplicates
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    
    # Standardize date formats
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce')
    
    # Handle missing values
    df = df.dropna(subset=['amount', 'date'])

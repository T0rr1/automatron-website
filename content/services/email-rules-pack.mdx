    Set olNamespace = olApp.GetNamespace("MAPI")
    Set olRules = olNamespace.DefaultStore.GetRules()
    
    ' Create rule for client emails
    Set olRule = olRules.Create("Client Emails - Auto Sort", olRuleReceive)
    
    ' Set conditions
    Set olConditions = olRule.Conditions
    olConditions.SenderAddress.Enabled = True
    olConditions.SenderAddress.Address = Array("@clientdomain.com", "@anotherclient.com")
    
    ' Set actions
    Set olActions = olRule.Actions
    olActions.MoveToFolder.Enabled = True
    olActions.MoveToFolder.Folder = olNamespace.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox).Folders("Clients")

foreach ($ruleConfig in $config.Rules) {
    Write-Host "Creating rule: $($ruleConfig.Name)"
    
    # Create new rule
    $rule = $rules.Create($ruleConfig.Name, 1) # olRuleReceive = 1
    
    # Configure conditions
    if ($ruleConfig.SenderContains) {
        $rule.Conditions.SenderAddress.Enabled = $true
        $rule.Conditions.SenderAddress.Address = $ruleConfig.SenderContains
    }

        $rule.Conditions.Subject.Text = $ruleConfig.SubjectContains
    }
    
    # Configure actions

        $rule.Actions.MoveToFolder.Enabled = $true
        $rule.Actions.MoveToFolder.Folder = $targetFolder
    }

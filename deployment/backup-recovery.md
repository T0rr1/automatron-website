# Backup and Recovery Procedures

## Overview
This document outlines the backup and recovery procedures for the Automatron.ai website.

## Backup Strategy

### What is Backed Up
- **Content**: All MDX files, images, and static assets
- **Configuration**: Package files, Next.js config, environment templates
- **Code**: Source code, components, and utilities
- **Deployment**: Scripts, workflows, and deployment configurations

### Backup Schedule
- **Daily**: Full backup at 2 AM UTC
- **On-demand**: Manual backups via GitHub Actions
- **Pre-deployment**: Automatic backup before major releases

### Storage Locations
1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts** (90 days retention)
2. **AWS S3** (long-term storage, if configured)
3. **Local Development** (manual backups)

## Creating Backups

### Automated Backups
Backups are automatically created daily via GitHub Actions:
```bash
# Trigger manual backup
gh workflow run backup.yml
```

### Manual Backups
```bash
# Create full backup
npm run backup

# Or use the script directly
node scripts/backup.js
```

### Backup Contents
Each backup includes:
- Compressed archive (.tar.gz)
- Manifest file with metadata
- File checksums for integrity verification
- Git commit information

## Recovery Procedures

### Full Site Recovery
```bash
# Download backup archive
# Extract and restore
node scripts/recovery.js path/to/backup.tar.gz
```

### Partial Recovery
```bash
# Extract specific files from backup
tar -xzf backup.tar.gz specific/file/path
```

### Emergency Recovery Steps
1. **Assess the situation**
   - Identify what needs to be recovered
   - Determine the scope of the issue

2. **Select appropriate backup**
   - Check backup manifest for timestamp and version
   - Verify backup integrity

3. **Prepare recovery environment**
   - Ensure clean working directory
   - Backup current state if partially functional

4. **Execute recovery**
   - Run recovery script
   - Verify restored files
   - Test functionality

5. **Validate recovery**
   - Run tests
   - Check critical functionality
   - Monitor for issues

## Backup Verification

### Integrity Checks
- SHA256 checksums for all files
- Manifest validation
- Archive format verification

### Test Restores
- Monthly test restores to verify backup quality
- Automated validation in staging environment

## Disaster Recovery

### RTO/RPO Targets
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 24 hours

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Level 1**: Automated recovery attempts
2. **Level 2**: Manual recovery by development team
3. **Level 3**: Full disaster recovery with external support

### Communication Plan
- Status page updates
- Team notifications
- Customer communication (if applicable)

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Backup Monitoring
- Daily backup success/failure alerts
- Storage capacity monitoring
- Backup integrity verification

### Recovery Testing
- Monthly recovery drills
- Automated recovery validation
- Documentation updates

## Security Considerations

### Backup Security
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Access controls on backup storage
- Audit logging for backup access

### Recovery Security
- Verification of backup authenticity
- Secure recovery procedures
- Post-recovery security validation

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review backup logs weekly
- Test recovery procedures monthly
- Update documentation quarterly
- Review and update retention policies annually

### Backup Cleanup
- Automated cleanup of old backups
- Archive important historical backups
- Monitor storage usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Backup fails to create**
   - Check disk space
   - Verify permissions
   - Review error logs

2. **Recovery fails**
   - Verify backup integrity
   - Check target directory permissions
   - Ensure dependencies are available

3. **Partial corruption**
   - Use checksums to identify corrupted files
   - Restore only affected files
   - Verify application functionality
